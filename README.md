# GMDelta

This project was developed by [Starz0r](starz0r) and [Sudnep](sudnep) as 
a easy way to remove a framerate cap from a GameMaker: Studio project with little to no effort required.

## Introduction

GMDelta is a project made for those who want to recieve noticable performance changes without much optimization, or
difficult code rummaging and repairing to ensure everything works correctly. We built this in mind that everything

that you open up a Issue on the GitHub Repoisitory and we will try to get to it as soon as possible.
