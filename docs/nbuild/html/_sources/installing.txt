Installation
============
Download the latest release from the 
`GitHub Repository <https://github.com/Starz0r/GMDelta/releases>`_.

Extract the ZIP with a archival tool like 
`WinRAR <http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm>`_. or 
`7Zip <http://www.7-zip.org/download.html>`_.

Add the object delta_control to the project in GameMaker: Studio by Right Clicking on
the Objects Resource Tree and selecting Add Existing Object and navigating to
the object and opening it.

While the .gml scripts can be added the same way, the most efficient way of adding 
them would be closing the GameMaker: Studio project that is currently opened, 
navigate to the location of the project files, and open it and put them in the 
/scripts/ directory.

Re-open the project in GameMaker: Studio once you are finished.
